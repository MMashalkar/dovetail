 # A Simple IOU Smart Contract Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the steps to model, implement and test smart contracts into blockchain platform of your choice. The example is a simple "I owe you" use case, the issuer of an IOU is obligated to pay the owner of the IOU amount issued, the ownership of the IOU can be transferred by current owner, and all transactions will be recorded on the ledger.

Before getting started, you should have your development environment [setup](../../development/devenv/setup.md).

******

## 1. Model IOU Smart Contract
### *1.1 Introduction to smart contract modeling*
Project Dovetail™ supports [Hyperledger Composer modeling language](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/v0.19/reference/cto_language.html) to model smart contract assets and transactions, not all features are supported, see below for support and limitations
* **Features Supported**
    - Resource definitions, including assets, concepts, enums, transactions, events and participants.
    - Relationships
    - Imports
    - Decorators, Project Dovetail™ has a predefine set of decorators

* **Features Not Supported Yet**
    - Field validators

* **Limited Support**

   In order to be blockchain agnostic, Project Dovetail™ maps participants to network participant's identity, e.g. MSP identifier for Hyperledger Fabric, and party's legal name for R3 Corda, participants are not stored on the ledger. Project Dovetail™ defines a Party participant in its system namespace, it should be used by all resource definitions where participants are required, and Party should be alreays be by reference since they are exsiting entities.

### *1.2 IOU Smart Contract*
We will use Visio Studio Code to create IOU smart contract model.
- create a workspace folder, e.g. tutorial
- create subfolders under tutorial
     - artifacts
     - network
        - fabric
        - corda
- copy [template project](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/dovetail/blob/master/docs/content/labs/IOUApp/template) to the workspace, and rename the project as iou
- under folder iou/model, create a file iou.cto
- copy following resource definitions into iou.cto file
```
    namespace com.example.iou

    import  com.tibco.dovetail.system.*

    asset  IOU identified by linearId extends LinearState {
      --> Party issuer
      --> Party owner
      o Amount amt
    }

    /*
    @InitiatedBy
      - arg0: comma delimited list of authorized participants in the format of $tx.path.to.participant, or * for any participant
      - arg1: optional, comma delimited list of required attributes that must exist in the initiator's certificate in the format of name=value.
    */
    @InitiatedBy("$tx.iou.issuer")
    transaction IssueIOU {
      o IOU iou
    }

    @InitiatedBy("$tx.iou.owner")
    transaction TransferIOU {
      --> IOU iou //by reference because the asset is already on the ledger
      --> Party newOwner
    }

    /* 
    @Query : mark transaction as query only
    */
    @Query()
    transaction getIOU {
      o String linearId
    }

     @Query()
    transaction getIOUIssuedBy {
      o String issuerPartyId
    }
```
- Run Composer command from toturial directory to package the iou project, it will create a iou.bna file
   > composer archive create -a iou.bna -t dir -n iou

## 2. Import IOU Smart Contract Model
* Start up Project Dovetail™ Studio, it will display web URL to use
* Go to a browser and open the Web Studio
* Go to Connections Tab > Add Connection > Select Composer Connector
* Give the connection a name, then "Browse" to find the iou.bna file, click "Save Model" button. 

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="recordings/importbna.gif"><img src="recordings/importbna.gif" alt="Import Model" style="max-width:75%;"></a></p>

## 3. Implement IOU Smart Contract
### *3.1 IssueIOU Transaction*
* Go to Apps Tab > Create to create a new Application "IOU"
* Create a flow > flow name "IssueIOU" > Select "SmartContract TXN Trigger" > Select "IOU" from model dropdown > Select "com.example.iou.IssueIOU" from transaction dropdown > Click "Done" button
* We will add a logger activity, ledger activity and response activity. We will also validate input before writing to ledger. 

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="recordings/issueiou.gif"><img src="recordings/issueiou.gif" alt="Issue IOU" style="max-width:75%;"></a></p>

### *3.2 TransferIOU Transaction*
* Create a new flow to implement TransferIOU transaction
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="recordings/transferiou.gif"><img src="recordings/transferiou.gif" alt="Transfer IOU" style="max-width:75%;"></a></p>

### *3.3 getIOU Transaction*
* Create a new flow to implement getIOU transaction
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="recordings/getiou.gif"><img src="recordings/getiou.gif" alt="Get IOU" style="max-width:75%;"></a></p>

### *3.4 getIOUIssuedBy Transaction*
* Create a new flow to implement getIOUIssuedBy transaction
* We use "Custom Query" activity to query the ledger. This activity is **NOT blockchain agnostic**
   - define a input parameter "issuerId"
   - define blochchain specific query string, use _$paramName for input substitution, in this example, we use [Hyperledger Fabric CouchDB query syntax](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/couchdb_tutorial.html)

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="recordings/getiouissuedby.gif"><img src="recordings/getiouissuedby.gif" alt="Get IOU Issued by" style="max-width:75%;"></a></p>

## 4. Export IOU Smart Contract Application
* Go to IOU application
* Click on "Export app" button, save the file IOU.json to artifacts folder

## 5. Generate Blockchain Artifacts

### *5.1 Hyperledger Fabric*
Run following command from tutorial directory Hyperledger Fabric chaincode is written to tutorial/artifacts/hlf folder

For testing, transaction security support is not enabled.

> /path/to/dovetail-cli contract generate -b fabric -m artifacts/IOU.json -v 1.0.0 -t artifacts/

### *5.2 R3 Corda*
Run folloowing command from tutorial directory, R3 Corda contract is written to tutorial/artifacts/corda folder, put kotlin-IOU-1.0.0.jar on your classpath to develop CordApps.

> /path/to/dovetail-cli contract generate -b corda -m artifacts/IOU.json -v 1.0.0 -t artifacts/ --namespace com.example.iou

## 6. Test IOU Smart Contract
### *6.1 Hyperledger Fabric*
* Copy [sample Hyperledger Fabric Network](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/dovetail/blob/master/tutorial/examples/network/fabric) to your network/fabric directory
* Follow [instructions](network/fabric/README.md), assuing you are running commands from fabric directory.

### *6.2 R3 Corda*
* Copy [sample R3 CordApp](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/dovetail/blob/master/docs/content/labs/IOUApp/network/corda) to network/corda directory
* Follow [instructions](network/corda/README.md)

## 7. Import an existing application
* You can import an application into Project Dovetail™ Studio
   - Go to Project Dovetail™ Studio
   - Create a new Application "IOUImport", click on "Import" button, use this [IOU.json](artifacts/IOU.json)
